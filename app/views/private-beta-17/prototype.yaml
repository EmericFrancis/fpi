date: 2017-03-20
description: |
  <p>building toward to public beta - releasable.</p>
  <p>public beta proposition = "if you can have a letter delivered there, and want to know who owns it*, you can get that from this service" <br>*owners, lenders, tenure, price, rough extent</p>
  <p>MVP of 'take it away' and VAT receipt:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>- most people do not need a VAT receipt (citizens, many orgs) - if needed, have to download or print</li>
  <li>- if you want to keep the information you bought - download or print</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Improved accessibility (things learnt from Digital Accessibility Centre report)
  <br>
