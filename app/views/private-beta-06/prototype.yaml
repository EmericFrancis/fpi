  <p>current production plus 'sign-in or register' plus tweaks to copy to make new flow sit better</p>

changelog:
  - todo... 
  - title number back - can be on every page after sign in
  - words back to prod version (although we know they dont work well)
  - sympatheic words about signin and account on the pages around it
  - signin and register as per v5 - with some minor word tweaks
  - improve fwd journey if your 'account' exists -> by your email address we know you
  - youve logged out - journey fwd is back to start page
  - pwd reset (aka forgotten pwd) - at end make it clearer people are now signed in
  - forgotten pwd - becomes reset pwd - consider improve copy and offering reset pwd
  - terms and condition need reworking (add just what needed for signin and register)
  - pages for more user journeys (less 'happy path') - session timed out; reset password email addr isnt one we have;
  - ensure we are always giving someone a forward option

  - why are we asking for phone number - better copy needed
