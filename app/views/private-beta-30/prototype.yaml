name: Mortgaged?
date: 2017-09-00

stickers: 
  status: experimental
  tested: 

hypothesis:
  - can we, more successfully, answer the question - has my mortgage been paid off? (people are looking for confirmation / that 'official' records are up to date?)
  - we've been making users work out that no mortgage information (on the last page) means there's no mortgage.  
  - we've been confusing people by saying different things at different points in the journey

learnt:

description: 
  - tell people if there is/isn't a mortgage
  - be clearer about the actual information they are getting
  - show when the morgtage information was last updated (added, deleted, updated)
  - be clearer about updates pending in the background

changelog:
  - done...
