      <h2 class="heading-medium">User needs</h2>
      <p>People want the information presented in the summary page to be able to do something else.</p>
      <p>People usually, rather than say what they are going to specifically do, say that they want to keep a copy of this information - take it away.</p>
      <p>There are specific things people are going to do next, but there is also a general desire to keep a copy of this thing - 'for my records'.  This is in part driven by the fact that they have to pay to get a copy of this information.</p>
      <p>In paying for this information, and that the VAT can be claimed back, we have a receipt.  People have desires/needs, around
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>claim back / not pay the VAT</li>
        <li>show proof of purchase / cost - e.g. to someone else - to 'bill them'</li>
        <li>if something goes wrong between paying and receiving the summary, be able to tell/show us what they were doing, to get a resolution - e.g. money back, a copy of the summary</li>
        <li>if people are not happy when they get the summary / or later on - a way to refer to their transaction/purchase</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">MVP</h2>
      <p>We've considered reaccess / longer access to the summary.  We've considered silently emailing the receipt to people.</p>
      <p>Indiviuals can't claim VAT, and we think infrequent org users wont bother with 50p VAT back (costs more in time than is reclaimed). As such it's low priority and gets in the way on the summary page - It's not what people have come for. If something goes wrong with the financial transaction, worldpay has already sent them a worldpay acknowledgement with a transaction id we can trace to their purchase.</p>
      <p>So we're trying 'if you want to keep the information for longer, or get a receipt, download or print'. Some options from Proto V17:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li><a href="private-beta-17/display_title?title_number=DN1012390&email=asdf%40df.vmv&transId=3043404577&searchType=D">opt 1 - freehold - Intro line and download button, print link</a></li>
        <li><a href="private-beta-17/display_title?title_number=DN1012402&email=asdf%40df.vmv&transId=3043404577&searchType=D">opt 1 - leasehold - Intro line and download button, print link</a></li>
