      <p class="lede">Ideas / examples for search results</p>
      <p>Ideas here are a mix of ideas, they: might not be possible, might be hard to do, might be undesirable</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">User needs</h2>
      <p>Not a user need - 'as a user i want search results' (not something they would say, contains a solution, etc).  But as part of the journey we are asking <strong class="bold"> the user has to pick the right title record that will contain the fact</strong> that answers their question</p>
      <p>Note: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs">capturing, wrtitng and sharing user needs</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/writing-user-stories">how to write user stories</a></p>
      <p>We'll list here, more we know about how users might find the right title record, and existing problems they have in similar service (like FaP), and current FPI and things we've learnt from the lab, and other forms of feedback</p>

      <h2 class="heading-large">Search result examples</h2>
      <p>Examples of how the search results could appear.  Showing some options, but also asking a lot of questions (user, how we have stuff stored, technology).  Need to add more real world examples of how buildings/sub buildings are organised and how we have stored the titles, and ho wthey can/cannot be linked</p>
