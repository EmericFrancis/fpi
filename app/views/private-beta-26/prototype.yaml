description: 
  - iteration of V25, now we've learnt more from real data / written code
  - ambition = best ever search (we should define best)
  - search results are are a list of addresses in that postcode
  - property address page for every address (each result that is a link)

changelog:
  - done...
  - every address in a postcode
  - result per address
  - page per property if address has >1 title record
  - page per property - link to each about this title page
  - if address = 1 title, address link goes to about this title
  - font weight normal for addresses
  - spacing of addresses on results
  - content (remember error states)
  - if not postcode search - results per title?
  - page per title back link returns to page per property (if that was the route)
