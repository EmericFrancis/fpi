      <p>Approx 250 postcodes contain more than 100 titles.  Howevere we don't know how many postcodes contain more than 100 delivery points - According to the internet no postcdoe has more than 100 delivery points (addresses).</p>
      <p>If we need to do this (perhaps OS don't care if one postcode contains over 100, and we were to display them all.</p>
      <p>Postcodes are restircted to 100 delivry points.  on average they contain 15.  1.7 million postcodes. Total no addressable properties around 25million.   If there were to be a few postcodes over 100 addresses - would OS care?  Such a tiny percentage, and barely an issue for screenscraping of data.</p>
      <p>If we have to - only explain/force the user to do something additional when more than 100 exist, following a postcode only search</p>
