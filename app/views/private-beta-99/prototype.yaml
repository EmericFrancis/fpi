name: User task - pick the property i'm interested in
date: 2017-07-30

stickers: 
  status: experimental
  tested: 
    - 08 Sept 2017

hypothesis:
  - Can a relative find out if the mortgage on their Mum's flat has been paid off?
  - If looking to find out about land, will people understand (and go to) Find a property?
  - Is search/results more successful if postcode -> postal address -> titles at place -> title?
  - <a href="#">link to google doc</a>

learnt:
  - people often pick the wrong title (freehold instead of leasehold) - because they don't know which one, or confidently make the wrong choice. 
  - many people don't expect there to be more than one owner / property title at an address
  - people don't know what 'title' is / means
  - many people think 'purchase date' is the date the property was purchased (rather than date buying this 'document')
  - <a href="#">link to google doc</a>

description: 
  - User task pick the property i'm interested in (pick title record i need) - address search (not the same as a user goal)
  - This is not a fully working flow, and we have not decided to build exactly this
  - These prototyped pages may need explanation of why they exist / what they illustrate
changelog:
  - done...
  - 
  - todo (not essential)...
